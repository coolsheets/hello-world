# Hello-World

Hi there! I'm passionate about simplifying complex geospatial challenges, building scalable, innovative solutions, and exploring the endless possibilities of data. Currently honing my full-stack development skills with MERN, and blending them with years of experience in geomatics, sustainability, and systems thinking.

Let's create something awesome together!
